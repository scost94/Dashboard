        <h2>General Concepts</h2>
        <p class="lead">I will talk here about some general concepts about data quality and analysis in finance.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data quality is a top priority for financial firms and it has only grown in importance because of
            regulation and the need for better operational efficiency. Data quality is hard to measure in the absence of
            a clear definition.
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Net asset value per share (NAVPS) is an expression for net asset value that represents the value per share
            of a mutual fund, an exchange-traded fund (ETF), or a closed-end fund.
            It is calculated by dividing the total net asset value of the fund or company by the number of shares
            outstanding and is also known as book value per share.
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Shares outstanding refer to a company's stock currently held by all its shareholders, including share
            blocks held by institutional
            investors and restricted shares owned by the companyâ€™s officers and insiders.
            In other words, the number of shares outstanding represents the amount of stock on the open market.
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li>A class of shares is a type of listed company stock that is differentiated by the level of voting rights
            shareholders receive.
            For example, a listed company might have two share classes, or classes of stock,
            designated as Class A and Class B
